Github is a collaberation or single user source control system where indicduals can store and edit code. It was created in 2005  by Linus Torvalds and though there are many other applications just like this (CVS, Subversion, BitKeeper, Mercurial) Github is the most well know and used. I find this platform usefull for not only storing code but for small collaberation projects, though for sites that need to be run through specfifc applications like django it is only good as a storage systme and a way for others to see it.
